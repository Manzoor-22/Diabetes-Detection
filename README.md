# Diabetes-Detection

According to WHO:

"Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs either when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. 
Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood glucose. Hyperglycaemia, also called raised blood glucose or raised blood sugar, is a common effect of uncontrolled diabetes and over time leads to serious damage to many of the body's systems, especially the nerves and blood vessels."

Diabetes is a disease that occurs when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high. Glucose is your bodyâ€™s main source of energy. Your body can make glucose, but glucose also comes from the food you eat.

# Overview
This project aims to create a machine learning model that can predict the likelihood of an individual having diabetes based on certain medical features, all patients here are **Females** and at least **21 years old** of Pima Indian heritage. The model is built using a dataset containing various health-related attributes, and it leverages the power of machine learning to provide valuable insights into diabetes risk assessment.

# Dataset Features
- Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
- Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
- BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
- Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
- Age: Age (in years)
- Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1)

# Methodology
The project involves the following main steps:

- Data Preprocessing: The dataset is thoroughly examined and cleaned to handle missing values, outliers, and any anomalies that might affect model performance.

- Feature Engineering: Relevant features are selected, and new features may be created to enhance the predictive power of the model.

- Model Building: Machine learning algorithms(Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, NaiveBayes Classification) are employed to train and test.

- Model Evaluation: The selected model is evaluated on unseen data to determine its generalization performance and predictive accuracy.

- Metics Evaluation : The performance of each model is evaluated using Accuracy Score, Precision Score and Confusion Matrix.
